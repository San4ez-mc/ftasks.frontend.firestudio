# **App Name**: Fineko TaskFlow

## Core Features:

- Task Management: Create, update, and manage daily and general tasks with descriptions, due dates, and status.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft coral (#F08080) to bring a touch of warmth and modernity, reflecting the user's desire for an orange-gray palette in a more contemporary form. The prompt suggests use cases aligned with focus, dedication, and a professional environment; given this guidance, a light color scheme would be counter.
- Background color: Dark gray (#333333) to provide a clean, modern backdrop that makes the elements pop, which complements the modern and clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#ADD8E6) as a cool, complementary contrast to the coral, suitable for interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to provide a balance of modernity and readability. Since the app anticipates larger blocks of text, the pairing provides excellent readability and visual harmony.
- Maintain minimal padding and margins across the application to maximize screen real estate.
- Implement a responsive layout to ensure compatibility across mobile and desktop devices.
- Use a set of clean, consistent icons that align with the modern style.
